The Splunk Security Content Exchange was designed to bring the community together to improve our collective defenses. By sharing research and analytics, we can help the entire industry craft more effective strategies. This project provides a mechanism to facilitate this exchange. 

The repo includes a collection of security guides called Analytic Stories that provide background on TTPs, mapped to the MITRE framework, the Lockheed Martin Kill Chain, and CIS controls. They include Splunk searches, machine-learning algorithms, and Splunk Phantom playbooks (where available)â€”all designed to work together to detect, investigate, and respond to threats. 

You can set this tool to run [detections and automatically](https://github.com/splunk/analytic_story_execution) funnel the results to investigations, reducing the need for manual intervention. When available, you can automatically trigger reponses, as well. The alerts you'll get include context (history, correlations, etc.), so they help you better understand their importance. The net effect is a more efficient workflow, as well as more comprehensive, effective defenses.

Follow the instructions below to get started.


# Usage
The Splunk Security Content Exchange can be used via:

#### [Splunk App](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/releases)
Grab the latest release of DA-ESS-ContentUpdate and install it on a Splunk Enterprise server (search head).

#### [API](https//docs.splunkresearch.com/?version=latest)
```
curl -s https://content.splunkresearch.com | jq
{
  "hello": "welcome to Splunks Research security content api",
  "available_endpoints": [
    "/stories",
    "/detections",
    "/investigations",
    "/baselines",
    "/responses",
    "/package"
  ]
}
```

# What's in an Analytic Story?
[Analytic Stories](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/blob/develop/docs/stories_categories.md) and their corresponding searches are composed of **.yml** files (manifests) and associated .conf files. The stories reside in [/stories](/stories) and the searches live in [/detections](/detections). 

Manifests contain a number of mandatory and optional fields. You can see the full field list for each piece of content [here](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/tree/develop/docs#spec-documentation).

# Writing Content
First, make sure to follow the steps to install **dependencies and pre-commit hooks** under ["Developing"](https://github.com/splunk/security-content#developing) before you begin. 

1. Select the content [piece](https://github.com/splunk/security-content#content-parts) you want to write. 
2. Copy an example and edit it to suit your needs. At a minimum, you must write a [story](stories/), [a detection search](detections/), and an [investigative search](investigations/).
3. Make a pull request. If Circle CI fails, refer to [troubleshooting](https://github.com/splunk/security-content#troubleshooting).

# Security Content Layout
![](static/structure.png)

#### Content Parts
* [stories/](stories/): All Analytic Stories 
* [detections/](detections/): Splunk Enterprise, Splunk UBA, and Splunk Phantom detections that power Analytic Stories
* [investigations/](investigations/): Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Phantom investigative searches and playbooks employed by Analytic Stories
* [responses/](responses/): Automated Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Phantom responses triggered by Analytic Stories
* [baselines/](baselines/): Splunk Phantom and Splunk Enterprise baseline searches needed to support detection searches in Analytic Stories

#### Supporting Parts
* [package/](package/): Splunk content app-source files, including lookups, binaries, and default config files
* [bin/](bin/): All binaries required to produce and test content

# Docs
* [docs/](docs/): Documentation for all spec files
* [spec/](spec/): All spec files that describe the security content

# Developing
##### Dependecies and Pre-Commit Hooks
Install project dependecies and tests that run before content is committed:

1. Create virtualenv and install requirements: `virtualenv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Install `pre-commit install`.

##### CI Tools
Tools that help with testing CI jobs:

1. Install CircleCI [CLI Tool](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/#installation).
2. To test a local change to CircleCI or build, make sure you are running Docker, then enter
`circleci local execute -e GITHUB_TOKEN=$GITHUB_TOKEN --branch <your branch>`.

#### Generate Docs from Schema 
To automatically generate docs from schema:

1. Install https://github.com/adobe/jsonschema2md.
2. Enter `jsonschema2md -d spec/v2/detections.json.spec -o docs`.

# Troubleshooting
#### Our Automated Tests
1. [CI](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/blob/44946063173f7bc9921f0da0aa62139c084d1c51/.circleci/config.yml#L27) validates that the content was written to spec using [`validate.py`](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/blob/runstory/bin/generate.py). To run validation manually, run: `python bin/validate.py --path . --verbose`.
2. [CI](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/blob/44946063173f7bc9921f0da0aa62139c084d1c51/.circleci/config.yml#L60) generates Splunk configuration files using [`generate.py`](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/blob/develop/bin/generate.py). If you want to export Splunk .conf files manually from the content, run `python bin/generate.py --path . --output package --verbose`.
3. [CI](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/blob/44946063173f7bc9921f0da0aa62139c084d1c51/.circleci/config.yml#L107) builds a DA-ESS-ContentUpdate Splunk package using the [Splunk Packaging Toolkit](http://dev.splunk.com/view/packaging-toolkit/SP-CAAAE9V). 
4. [CI](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/blob/44946063173f7bc9921f0da0aa62139c084d1c51/.circleci/config.yml#L145) tests the newly produced package using [Splunk Appinspect](http://dev.splunk.com/view/appinspect/SP-CAAAE9U).

* note that [requirements.txt](https://github.com/splunk/security-content/blob/develop/requirements.txt) hardcodes the versions for packages we use [dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) to make sure we safely always upgrade to the latest versions.
