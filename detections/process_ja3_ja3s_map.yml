eli5: It's difficult to get a handle on what's happening inside encrypted traffic, but it is possible to profile SSL/TLS connections. This
      query takes JA3 signatures and matches them up to process data, allowing insight into what apps are causing encrypted network traffic.
      It also matches that data with the JA3s and server information. By combining process + JA3 + JA3S + server information, analysts can 
      effectivly discover new process server pairings, and have a way to track them via network based signatures.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting Bro SSL logs w/JA3 + JA3S signatures. Additionally you'll need
                  Carbon Black 'netconn' logs to map the process to network traffic (destination IP). If you want to use this with OSX 
                  clients, you'll need to create a KV store of MD5 -> Process Path to work around a Carbon Black agent issue.
