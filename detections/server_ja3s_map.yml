eli5: Mapping JA3S to server name or IP address can be useful in understanding infrastructure beyond your enterprise perimeter. 
      Hunting through this kind of data will help you discover new destination infrastructure as well as if it (likely) relates to
      any existing discovered infrastructure based on server config (JA3S signature). This can be used to track known malicious
      server configurations as well.
