name: Suspicious Emails
narrative: 'It is a common practice for attackers of all types to leverage targeted
  spearphishing campaigns and mass mailers to deliver weaponized email messages and
  attachments. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to monitor email data in Splunk
  to detect suspicious content.\

  Once a phishing message has been detected, the next steps are to answer the following
  questions: \

  1. Which users have received this or a similar message in the past?\

  1. When did the targeted campaign begin?\

  1. Have any users interacted with the content of the messages (by downloading an
  attachment or clicking on a malicious URL)?This Analytic Story provides detection
  searches to identify suspicious emails, as well as contextual and investigative
  searches to help answer some of these questions.'
